# Assets List
This details all of the art assets (i.e. non-code includables) that our game will need to be polished.
Feel free to add to this list if you think of something new, but keep in mind the following conventions:

- **Emboldened item**: something necessary. The mana symbol, for example.
- Normal item: something less necessary, e.g. unique, animated sprites for every different food class within every different chef class.
- *Italicized item*: something in progress. NOTE: do NOT mark this unless you have lifted the pen, so to speak. Just thinking about it doesn't count.
- ~~Stricken-through item~~: something complete. This status can be redacted, but the decision to do so should be taken seriously.

A quick key:
- Single asterisks around text italicizes.
- Double asterisks around text emboldens.
- Double tildes around text strikes it through.

## Visuals

### General
- Typography

### Title
- **Title.** Typography, image, what?
- **Background**
- Button backgrounds/borders

### Play
- Map background/skin
- **Unit sprite prototypes.** Consistent for all chefs. A meat, two fruits/vegetables, two wheat/grains.
- **Chef emblem/symbol.** Describes the class of chef.
- Chef faceplate. Shows the face of the chef to add personality. If done cleverly, this can be the same as the sprite we use for the dialogue screen.
- Mana/Spice/Gusto symbol
- Sprite for the back of a card
- Cards

### Dialogue
- **Background for the scene**
- **Character busts for important characters.** No, not THAT kind of bust. We're talking head-and-shoulders.
- Dialogue box
- Nameplate

## Audibles
### Songs
- **Title track.** Might be done? Cross this out, Villaroobs, if you think you're done working on this for the most part.
- **Gameplay (player's turn)**
- Gameplay (opponent's turn). If we can pump out this second one, great, but don't sweat it too much.
- Success
- Failure
- **Dialogue**

### Sound Effects
- **Button clicking noise**
- **Cursor move noise.** Triggers every time the cursor moves to a new tile.
- Cursor clicking noise. No unit in tile.
- **Cursor selection noise** Unit in tile.
- **Battle noise.** Unit fights another.
- **Death noise**
- Card-playing noise

## Edibles
Nah, I'm just playing. But if we do have another big meetup, maybe we should cook things to celebrate!
