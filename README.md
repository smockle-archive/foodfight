## Premise
Food Fight is a game about, well, doing battle with food.

## Mechanics
*Main article: [Mechanics][m]*

Players take turns moving their food units towards one another, fighting, and repositioning, while using cards to supplement their motions and perhaps even change the tides of battle entirely!

## Atmosphere and Universe
*Main article: [Atmosphere and Universe][a&u]*

The Food Fight world is basically just a slightly-zany Earth. Most of the plot takes place in America, whether or not that ends up being mentioned in-game (I think it's better not to mention it). Cooking and other "artful" hobbies seem like a much bigger deal in our game than they might seem in real life, but that's also because those are the professions of our characters. The food fights themselves are mostly just metaphors for the cooking battle, but honestly I would be okay if these were more literal fights. Adds a bit of silliness and fantasy to the game, especially since the characters don't ever need to address why/how it happens, just that it does and that's how cooking competitions work -- your food against theirs. Anyways. 

## Characters

It'd be cool if we could embed pictures here that link to the main article#char_name. Not sure what to put here for right now.

## Plot
*Main article: [Plot][p]*

The initial pieces of plot revolve around Willow and Arnald getting into cooking and starting to compete against one another. This scales up into a local cooking competition, and very quickly Willow becomes starry-eyed and passionate about the whole thing. Her first taste for blood drives her into making a goal to win the Silver Spoon competition, an annual and international test of chefery and personal spice. (This is likely all we really need from a zoomed-out, general perspective.) She gets caught up in a fervor of victory, and eventually the question becomes: Is she taking things too far? (bleh this is bad make it better jake come on)
