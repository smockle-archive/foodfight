## Introduction

### Willow Meets Up With Arnald

Willow comes to Arnald's house, which is an apartment next door. They reference that this is how they met. Willow lounges (upside down, legs over the back) on his couch. He asks her to make sure her shoes are off if she's gonna have feet on the couch. Noticing she's still a bit upset about what she's had on her mind, he offers to teach her how to cook his favorite meal. 

### Introductory Course

Arnald gives the game's tutorial, playing a small match against Willow. (Does this match include cards or passives? I would think her units/passives would be the same as his for this match.)

### Willow Takes an Interest

Arnald mentions that he learned to cook from his mom, but that he goes to competitions around the state for fun, as well as insight on his curriculum. Willow is a bit surprised that she is just learning this about him, but he mentions that she had her own stuff going on, and that he understands and isn't hurt, but she never really asked. So it just never came up. Either way, she gets excited about the quality of the meal she helped make, and asks Arnald how she should get started about cooking if she wants to be serious about it, citing an interest in focusing on something other than what's been on her mind. Arnald offers to go shopping with her sometime to help outfit her kitchen, and recommends checking out some local cook-offs and the Internet to start off with. 

## Timeskip

A few weeks pass, and Willow has started to seem a bit less mopey. Arnald has encouraged her, noting that she picked cooking up pretty quickly and mentioning this to her. He knows this will help her get further from her pain, which he is glad of. During this, the player will make Willow's decision about which kind(s) of food she wants to make.

## Willow Tries

### Preface

She's going to a local cook-off called the Aluminus Allons-y Cookery Challenge, a subevent of the larger Aluminus Allons-y festival. It's funded by the town university (the one Arnald is attending, which is primarily a culinary arts school), and celebrates the many aluminum-related facets of the mining town's culture, though cooking is strongly emphasized. Arnald comes with her to the festival, but decides not to compete, citing a lack of feeling "in the groove." (In reality, he doesn't want to risk out-performing her, knowing she is still in a sensitive state.) 

### Round 1

Willow is almost immediately put into the first round after arriving. She competes against someone fairly irrelevant. 

### Recess

It is at this time that Willow meets Merra and Shen, who are both watching the event, though she doesn't interact with them. She just notices them bickering off to the side during her time off after the first round, about whether or not considering where your ingredients come from is important -- Merra suggesting that she only wants to use ingredients that were obtained legitimately, which Shen asks for a definition of, and adds that that cost may be fine for her, but he needs to believe he lives in a society in which other people will take care of those things, so that he may assume that his ingredients are morally sound, and then he can be the best cook he can. He concludes that to worry about such a thing is to pour energy into something fruitless and disadvantageous for a chef. Merra tells him that she knows she's making the right decision, and is willing to put in the extra energy if she can do something she feels better about.

Willow is impressed that the area is so dynamic, that conversations like that can happen about cooking, and that this event can be this big, especially considering that students and alumni can't compete (they can only judge). She lounges back in a sigh of relief, having just found a lonelier place to sit and think. Arnald walks up and asks her how things are. She mentions that she feels pretty anxious, but says that she's honestly having a lot of fun. 

### Round 2

Willow notices Shen is on the judge's panel for this round, implying his either attending or having attended the university. Arnald says he doesn't recognize him, and doesn't seem fazed about him. Another irrelevant fight.

### Round 3

Another irrelevant fight. (These will eventually become more relevant!)

### Aftermath

*I'll write this up later. Basically, Willow does arbitrarily well, maybe wins the whole thing, and Arnald gives her approval.*

*Maybe need to fill this in, maybe don't. Getting to the point, though.*
