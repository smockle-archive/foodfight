Clay's Questions
================
1. "Who Is Fighting The Food" not sure about this title--it makes it sound like a person is fighting against food, but that's not actually what happens in our game, right? Our game is about food fighting against food. Or a chef fighting against a chef with food as proxy. But I may be wrong about how our game works, so someone please correct me.
2. Is "ethnic chefs" racist sounding? Like, the chefs themselves aren't necessarily ethnic--rather the food they prepare is.
3. Do titles like "How Do I Fight Food" need question marks?
4. Slide 3 is grammatically weird. Only the first bullet point addresses the question posed by the title. Bullet point #1 is a noun. Bullet points #2 and #3 are verbs or actions. Not sure how to fix.
5. Do you guys like Oxford commas or no?
6. Should subtitles like "Min-Target (March 22)" be displayed in a different color?
7. Should bullets be displayed in a different color?
8. First few titles ask questions (eg. Who Is Fighting The Food). Last few titles don't ask questions (eg. Plausibility). Should we consistify the titles (eg. saying Is This Really Plausible? instead of Plausibility)?

True, we can correct this Sunday
Probably should reword, although I don't really think it is racist. They are of different ethnicities
The font we are using doesn't have question marks
I'll look at it
:D

3, I got the font from Google Web Fonts. A newer version is available from the typographer's GitHub repo. The newer version fixes this.
