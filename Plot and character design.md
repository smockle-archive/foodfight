Plot
===
The initial pieces of plot revolve around Willow and Arnald getting into cooking and starting to compete against one another. This scales up into a local cooking competition, and very quickly Willow becomes starry-eyed and passionate about the whole thing. Her first taste for blood drives her into making a goal to win the Silver Spoon competition, an annual and national test of chefery and personal spice. (This is likely all we really need from a zoomed-out, general perspective.) Is she taking things too far?

Characters
===
Our characters are mostly chefs or cooks of some sort that have something vested in competing.
### Wyllis/Willow
**Likes**: Activity, winning, dogs, arts and crafts, milkshakes.

**Dislikes**: Being idle, losing, being direct, tomatoes.


Willow is an up-and-coming fusion chef and our main character. She gets into cooking because she has a rather dramatic knack for putting flavors together. At the beginning of our story, she is just really starting her development as a chef, and leans on cooking (and her spark for the novel) as her source of ego, having just dealt with a few tragedies in her life and suffering a low self-esteem. She tends to be a bright, optimistic person outwardly, but often gets hit by waves of doubt that she hides from even her closest friends. She isn't quite bubbly, but she is easily excited. She tends to be too tense or focused to seem bubbly. (Think Shizune from Katawa Shoujo.) She doesn't trust easily. She leans on her achievements as her core sense of self-worth. 


### Arnald
**Likes**: Listening, being social, experiencing life, fashion, naps.

**Dislikes**: Boredom, loneliness, feeling limited or controlled, waking up.

Arnald is a Spanish (or whatever we use as an analogue to this) foreign exchange student attending university in Willow's home town. He introduces her to the idea of cooking as a serious hobby or passion in an attempt to cheer her up and show her a bit of his culture. He kinda gets dragged along for the ride as she gets more and more into the culinary arts, which he is okay with; he admits that if she weren't there, nudging him, he probably wouldn't care enough to sharpen his skills. He is laid-back, and often a bit lazy, but he tends to care deeply for people he respects enough to call "friend."

### Simon
**Likes**: Being overzealous about everything, books, pasta (though he doesn't cook it professionally, it's important to him that it tastes and feels amateur), having vinyls he's never listened to.

**Dislikes**: Being called fake (though he won't change his behavior if you do), burning bridges, fish (but he's okay with sushi!), inclement weather (it scares him).

Simon is a chef from London who focuses on fusion cooking -- he is your first adversary in the game, and the first chef you meet besides Willow, with such a repertoire. He's got a flair for the dramatic, and comes across vain, but his friends understand that this is all a joke, and that he simply doesn't care how he's seen enough to change for people who don't understand it. He does actually feel strongly about a lot of things, but he also knows how his melodrama comes across and finds it humorous. He typically means what he is saying at least somewhat, but not to the magnitude he expresses.


### Shen
### Merra
**Likes**: Offering input, knowledge, seeming "put together", fashion, competition, moral discussion (but not so she can be swayed).

**Dislikes**: Not knowing every detail before making a decision, people she judges immoral, being hastened through her morning routine, showing weakness. (Also, not being tsun as fuck)

Merra is American by culture and raising but ethnically (as many of us are) Western European -- particularly German and Swiss.
