Plot
===
The initial pieces of plot revolve around Willow and Arnald getting into cooking and starting to compete against one another. This scales up into a local cooking competition, and very quickly Willow becomes starry-eyed and passionate about the whole thing. Her first taste for blood drives her into making a goal to win the Silver Spoon competition, an annual and national test of chefery and personal spice. (This is likely all we really need from a zoomed-out, general perspective.) Is she taking things too far?

### Wyllis/Willow
**Likes**: Activity, winning, dogs, arts and crafts, milkshakes.

**Dislikes**: Being idle, losing, being direct, tomatoes.


Willow is an up-and-coming fusion chef and our main character. She gets into cooking because she has a rather dramatic knack for putting flavors together. At the beginning of our story, she is just really starting her development as a chef, and leans on cooking (and her spark for the novel) as her source of ego, having just dealt with a few tragedies in her life and suffering a low self-esteem. She tends to be a bright, optimistic person outwardly, but often gets hit by waves of doubt that she hides from even her closest friends. She isn't quite bubbly, but she is easily excited. She tends to be too tense or focused to seem bubbly. (Think Shizune from Katawa Shoujo.) She doesn't trust easily. She leans on her achievements as her core sense of self-worth. She feels out of place in a large crowd, so cooking competitions are often very stressful for her, but she feels like the payout is wayyyy worth it. She knows she can win if she can put herself to work and get the stress out of her head when it's finally time to fight.


### Arnald
**Likes**: Listening, being social, experiencing life, fashion, naps.

**Dislikes**: Boredom, loneliness, feeling limited or controlled, waking up.

Arnald is a Spanish (or whatever we use as an analogue to this) foreign exchange student attending university in Willow's home town. He introduces her to the idea of cooking as a serious hobby or passion in an attempt to cheer her up and show her a bit of his culture. He kinda gets dragged along for the ride as she gets more and more into the culinary arts, which he is okay with; he admits that if she weren't there, nudging him, he probably wouldn't care enough to sharpen his skills. He is laid-back, and often a bit lazy, but he tends to care deeply for people he respects enough to call "friend." He has a vast talent for cooking, and in fact is studying to become a professional chef when our story begins. His natural ability to pick it up may even be greater than Willow's, but it is balanced by his sloth. He likes competing mostly because it is livening, because he can be there for Willow (and the other friends they pick up along the way), and because he likes getting to think on his feet.

### Simon
**Likes**: Being overzealous about everything, books, pasta (though he doesn't cook it professionally, it's important to him that it tastes and feels amateur), having vinyls he's never listened to.

**Dislikes**: Being called fake (though he won't change his behavior if you do), burning bridges, fish (but he's okay with sushi!), inclement weather (it scares him).

Simon is a chef from London who focuses on fusion cooking -- he is your first adversary in the game, and the first chef you meet besides Willow, with such a repertoire. He's got a flair for the dramatic, and comes across vain, but his friends understand that this is all a joke, and that he simply doesn't care how he's seen enough to change for people who don't understand it. He does actually feel strongly about a lot of things, but he also knows how his melodrama comes across and finds it humorous. He typically means what he is saying at least somewhat, but not to the magnitude he expresses. He is (perhaps ironically) very concerned with sincerity, and deceit grinds his gears more than any of our other characters except perhaps Merra. He gets excited about competing in cooking competitions because more people get to see his grandstanding humor style, and either get it and laugh or judge him wrongly. He likes that people often misunderstand him at first, and feels like that makes him stand out in people's minds (he's often right, for better or worse). Winning is nice, too, but mostly the game of being more confident (while still being competent enough to at least mostly back it up) is the one he is interested in, and the one he always wins.


### Shen
**Likes**: Games of skill, reason, saving money, moral discussion (sometimes to sway, sometimes to understand), fiction, magic systems and rules, salt.

**Dislikes**: People behaving irrationally, traditionalism, music without an emphatic vocalist, being called robotic.

Shen is a person who already has to deal with his insecurities about how human he seems and doesn't need your input on it. He likes thinking about balance, about the flaws in something that he could maybe remove with proper consideration, and about how he might or might not impact humanity as a whole. Very high-minded, he often gets stuck on how things *should* be instead of how they *are*. He likes competing to prove his immense talent and self-motivated attitude as worthwhile (positive confirmation bias!), but sometimes lets this overlap into his other social behaviors (not so positive!). More specifically, he can be harsh and brutally realistic and finds this to be proper friend behavior. While many disagree, his victories tend to reinforce his entire personality, making him feel like he is successful and doesn't need to change. His biggest frustrations come from people forcing their beliefs on others in a way that pre-empts their ability to be rational (e.g. teaching kids a faith before they have a chance to be reasonable about it, etc.).


### Merra
**Likes**: Offering input, knowledge, seeming "put together", fashion, competition, fantasy novels, moral discussion (but not so she can be swayed).

**Dislikes**: Not knowing every detail before making a decision, people she judges immoral, being hastened through her morning routine, showing weakness. (Also, not being tsun as f*ck.)

Merra is American by culture and raising but ethnically (as many of us are) Western European -- particularly German and Swiss. She finds it difficult to trust fully in anyone (due to being taught as such by her childhood), and therefore becomes uncomfortable whenever she needs to make decisions that rely on others. While this, as well as her strong sense of justice, can make her seem strict or harsh in some siutations, this honestly doesn't come up much in conversation. She tends to be fun-loving, and she likes dressing up and interacting with lots of people. She gets excited about big competitions, both because she likes to prove that she has a sound worldview (confirmation bias!) and because she likes communicating with so many people in a short time. She defines communication how a psychologist would -- touch, body language, speech, and (in her case, the culinary) arts all count.
